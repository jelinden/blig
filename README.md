# Blig

Blig is a markdown blog maker. Simple, with code syntax highlighting.

```
go get github.com/jelinden/blig
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jelinden/blig
go build
``` 

When starting for the first time, you need to give users credentials as parameters.

```
./blig -username username -password password
```

This is the only user the blog will have.
